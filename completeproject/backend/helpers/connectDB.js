// Notice all the variables such as uri,dbName,db,client are all global(outside of getDatabase function) why? Because we don't want to create a new MongoClient or db each time getDatabase is imported and called from other files, so Ä± make these variables global

const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017";
// Database Name
const dbName = "medicalportal";
